Wavefield simulation

This program simulate the propagation of waves including the arised interferences.
The user is able to set source or sources, through click inside the figure.
The figure also includes a line plot, which shows the amplitude of the wavefield 
at one choosen point (also through click inside the figure).

Install

To use this program you need to download the files: XX.m, YY.m.
To open and execute these files you also need Matlab.
To run the program just execute YY.m.
Attention: All the files have to be in the same directory.

About
This program was developed by Christoph Eike, Johannes Lühring and Max Zimmermann 
as part of a study assignment. 
The task is: 
Write a GUI-program, which simulates the propagation of some sinusoidal waves.
It should be able to define several sources, which trigger the accrual of the wavefield.
This wavefield have to show the propagation of the sinusoidal waves and their 
interferences. Also a line plot should be shown, which output the compound amplitude
of all sinusoidal waves. This line plot have to be able, to display the local amplitude 
of any point in the figure.
